synopsis: |
  **Taylor gets summoned to another world. Again.**

  This time the culprit is King Joaquim of Lavradio, who cares more about 
  watching netball than governing his bronze-age domain. The sooner Taylor 
  can get out of the palace and build a life away from the aristocracy, the better. 
  To do that he'll have to contest with a homicidal ambassador and an idiot prince, 
  all while keeping His Feckless Majesty entertained.

  Alas, good things never come easy. Before he can do business in Lavradio's capital 
  city Taylor will first have to save it. Unemployment, high rents, and an epidemic 
  can all be traced to a shadowy figure determined to push the city into chaos. Taylor 
  sets to work with new friends, from the palace to the slums and everywhere in between.
  Together, they'll drag the famously wicked Cosmetics Guild into the light and see
  justice done.

  Success means a better life for everyone. Failure could mean another death for Taylor,
  followed by reincarnation to someplace worse.
logline: |
  Another summons, another world. This time, Taylor has to find his way around bronze-age
  technology, a feckless king, and an all-powerful church; But something smells in the
  capital city, and it isn't just the sewers.
